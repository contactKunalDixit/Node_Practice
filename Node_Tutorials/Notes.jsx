Q: What is the difference between Browser Vs Node.JS ?
A: 
 Browser:
    We have access and work with DOM
    There is a Window Object in Browser which is native and comprises of various inbuilt methods and properties
    You can interact with applications through frontEnd functionality in Browser.
    There is No Filesystems to work with
    Fragmentations instead of Version
    ES6 Modules is used. e.g. import {<module>} from "../."  


NodeJS:
    Since the entire implementation happens in Terminal, hence there is no need for reaching browser. Hence, no DOM exists in NodeJS
    There uis no Window Object since window object comes from Browser and there in no Browser services that exists in NodeJS
    NODEJS in primarily used for Server Side Apps and services
    There is FileSystems structure that exsists
    Versions instead of Fragmentations
    CommonJS is used instead of ES6 modules e.g. const <moduleName> = require("./..")
